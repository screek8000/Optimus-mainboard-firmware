# Optimus-mainboard-firmware
Firmware with original delta calibration for Optimus mainboard (before the slider orientation changed).

I think the bigger calibration pattern is not needed, so I branched the last version with the original calibration pattern.
I will add my modifications to both branches, the master branch and this "original-calibration" branch.
